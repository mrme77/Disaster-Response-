# Disaster Response
###  **About the project:**

This project applies advanced data engineering and data science skills to analyze disaster data from real-world events. Using a dataset provided by Appen (formerly Figure 8), the project focuses on building a machine learning pipeline that categorizes disaster messages, enabling efficient routing to appropriate disaster relief agencies. 

A web application will also be developed to allow emergency workers to input messages and receive category-based classifications. The app includes data visualizations, demonstrating the effectiveness of the classification model. This project showcases expertise in creating end-to-end data pipelines, building interactive applications, and writing organized, production-quality code.
