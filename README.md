# Disaster Response
![Image](fire_department.jpg)
###  **Project Overview:**
This project analyzes thousands of real-world disaster messages to support efficient disaster response. Leveraging datasets of messages and their categories, it builds an ETL pipeline to clean, transform, and store the data in an SQLite database. This structured data is then used in a machine learning pipeline that categorizes each message, helping direct it to the relevant disaster relief agency.

An interactive web application will allow emergency responders to input messages and instantly receive category-based classifications. Additionally, the app includes visualizations that highlight the modelâ€™s performance, illustrating classification insights. This project demonstrates advanced skills in constructing end-to-end data pipelines, developing user-friendly applications, and producing clean, production-ready code.
