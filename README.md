Using messages and categories datasetes, the project focuses on building an ETL pipeline that process such data and load them in an sqlite database.Consequently, a machine learning pipeline will read from this database and categorizes disaster messages, enabling efficient routing to appropriate disaster relief agencies. 

A web application will also be developed to allow emergency workers to input messages and receive category-based classifications. The app includes data visualizations, demonstrating the effectiveness of the classification model. This project showcases expertise in creating end-to-end data pipelines, building interactive applications, and writing organized, production-quality code.
